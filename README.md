## Test React App

This small react app is a simple search to query stories from [Hacker News Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and display results.

It also has a History tab to show a list of terms that used for successful searching (terms that returned results).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
